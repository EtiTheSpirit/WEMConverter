# WEMConverter
Converts WEM to WAV or converts any audio format into WEM. 

**This exclusively supports the WAV-format based WEM files. You will need to use Wwise to get any other formats out.**

This will fail for any other encoding used on the WEM format (the console will also warn you that it will probably fail)

# Known Problems
- Cyberpunk 2077 seems to not get along with this program very well. See [Issue #6](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/WEMConverter/issues/6) for more information (as there is a crude way to get around this, sort of).
