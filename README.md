# WEMConverter
Converts WEM to WAV or converts any audio format into WEM, albeit with heavy limitations.

### This strictly supports only s16le WAV format audio files.
It was designed for use in No Man's Sky and a bunch of folks asked me to upload it. You will need to use Wwise to get any other formats out. Sorry. A lot of games use vorbis encoding and for that you can use wwise2ogg which has been around for a very, very long time.

**This will completely fail for any other encoding used on the WEM format** (the console will also warn you that it will probably fail). I do not have the time to resolve this right now. I'm sorry.

# Known Problems
- Cyberpunk 2077 seems to not get along with this program very well. See [Issue #6](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/WEMConverter/issues/6) for more information (as there is a crude way to get around this, sort of).
