# WEMConverter
Converts WEM to WAV or converts any audio format into WEM. 

**This exclusively supports the WAV format-based WEM files. You will need to use Wwise to get any other formats out.**

This will fail for any other encoding used on the WEM format (the console will also warn you that it will probably fail)
